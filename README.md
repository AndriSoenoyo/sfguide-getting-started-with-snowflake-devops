This repository contains the code for Snowflake DataOps Demo for YTL.

## Overview

Let's bring our database game to the next level by unleashing the power of Snowflake DataOps, empowering us to build safe and robust data pipelines. 

In this Demo, we will apply DataOps techniques to a data pipeline. We will automate the deployment of declarative database changes from Git, create a CI/CD pipeline, and separate our dev and prod environments.
